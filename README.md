Flickr Gradient Block
=====================

Remove gradient overlays from photos in your homepage feed.

Introduction
------------

The new Flickr activity feed uses a gradient overlay to make the photographer's name visible regardless of the background image's brightness. A side effect of this design is that every photo in the activity feed looks like it was shot with a graduated neutral density filter. This Chrome extension removes that gradient by default, and enables it only when you hover over the photographer's name or avatar.

Flickr is a great product. I can’t think of many other paid services I’ve used consistently  over the past decade. Overall I really like their redesign. The activity feed with its large images looks great, and the new photo page is equally nice. But this one homepage quirk has been bothering me, so I decided to create an option to change it.
